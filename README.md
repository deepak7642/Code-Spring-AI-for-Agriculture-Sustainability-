**Open Innovation -** *AI for Agriculture Sustainability*

Prototype Name - FarmReason AI

### **Problem Statement :-**

_**Modern agriculture faces increasing pressure to achieve high productivity while maintaining environmental sustainability.** Although extensive agronomic, climatic, and soil data are available, farmers and policymakers often lack decision-support systems that convert these data into clear, location- and crop-specific sustainability actions. Existing predictive models primarily classify sustainability levels but frequently plateau due to data quality constraints and overlapping indicators, offering limited guidance on how to improve sustainability outcomes. As a result, there is a critical gap between sustainability assessment and actionable farm-level and district-level interventions, highlighting the need for intelligent systems that integrate prediction with explainable, recommendation-driven insights to support informed agricultural decision-making._
